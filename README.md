# pest-detection-with-suitable-pesticides

Pest Detection and Suitable Pesticide is a web-based application designed to help farmers, gardeners, and plant enthusiasts quickly identify pests and find appropriate treatment methods. The system allows users to either capture a live image using their device’s camera or upload a photo of the affected plant.

Once the image is provided, the application processes it to identify the plant species and detect any pest infestations. It also provides a confidence score to indicate the accuracy of the detection. Based on the pest identified, the system recommends suitable solutions, divided into two main categories:

Chemical Pesticides – Lists effective insecticides, such as Imidacloprid, Malathion, and Acetamiprid, along with specific dosage instructions for safe and effective application.

Organic Solutions – Offers eco-friendly pest control options like Neem Oil, Insecticidal Soap, and Diatomaceous Earth, with clear application guidelines for sustainable farming practices.

The interface is simple, responsive, and visually appealing, using a clean design and vibrant colors for easy navigation. The structured layout ensures that users can upload images, view pest identification results, and read treatment instructions without confusion.

Key Features:

Image Input Options: Upload from device or capture directly via camera.

Automatic Detection: Identifies plant type and pest species.

Treatment Recommendations: Offers both chemical and organic solutions with correct usage details.

User-Friendly Design: Soft background colors, clear buttons, and organized sections for smooth navigation.

Sustainability Focus: Encourages safe pesticide usage and promotes organic alternatives to minimize environmental impact.

By combining quick pest detection with tailored pesticide recommendations, this project aims to reduce crop damage, improve plant health, and assist in sustainable agriculture practices. It can be especially beneficial in rural areas where expert guidance may not be readily available, providing instant, reliable information to protect plants and increase yield.
